        Over the past few months we've been working hard to bring you an even better StudyMonkey experience.
        Of course, we will always be continuing to add new features and improve StudyMonkey but for now
        we are happy to announce that we've launched some recent changes.
    </p>

    <h2>We've partnered with Notesolution.com!</h2>
    <p>
        We've decided to join forces with an awesome note-sharing website called Notesolution.com to offer you a new and improved note-sharing experience.

    <h3>What does this mean for you?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                All your notes-related needs will now be moved to Notesolution.com.  If you have shared or bought notes on StudyMonkey - no need to worry!
                <strong>All of your notes and credits will continue to be available on Notesolution.com!</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                It is now easier to access helpful resources like course reviews and professor ratings on StudyMonkey.
                <strong>You will no longer need to log in, so it will be easier to find courses and professors, easier to voice your opinion, and easier to share with friends!</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
