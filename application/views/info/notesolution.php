    Over the past few months we've been working hard to bring you an even better StudyMonkey experience.
    Of course, we will always be continuing to add new features and improve StudyMonkey but for now
    we are happy to announce that we've launched some recent changes.
</p>

<h3>We've partnered with Notesolution.com!</h3>
<p>
    We've decided to join forces with an awesome note-sharing website called Notesolution.com to offer you a new and improved note-sharing experience.
    What does this mean for you? It means that all your notes-related needs will now be moved to Notesolution.com.
    If you are an existing StudyMonkey user who has shared or bought notes - no need to worry!
    All of your notes, credits, and earnings will continue to be available on Notesolution.com! Your log-in information is exactly the
    same as your StudyMonkey information. You just need to follow these instructions:
    <ol>
        <li>XXX</li>
        <li>XXX</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>More to come!</h3>
<p>
    We are always looking for ways to improve your StudyMonkey experience. There are some exciting things we have coming your way that we're
    sure you'll love. If you have any ideas, suggestions, or feedback, we'd love to hear from you! Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.

    Yours Truly,
