        Over the past few months we've been working hard to bring you an even better StudyMonkey experience.
        Of course, we will always be continuing to add new features and improve StudyMonkey but for now
        we are happy to announce that we've launched some recent changes.
    </p>

    <h2>We've partnered with Notesolution.com!</h2>
    <p>
        We've decided to join forces with an awesome note-sharing website called Notesolution.com to offer you a new and improved note-sharing experience.
